# PRD: Small Business SEO Tool Simplification & Enhancement

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the simplification of the existing SEO topic generator to focus specifically on small local businesses, removing complex agency features while adding high-impact, low-complexity differentiators. The goal is to transform the current feature-rich tool into a simple, focused solution that generates content ideas local businesses can implement immediately without technical knowledge.

The core value proposition will be: "Generate content ideas customers actually search for" - positioning the tool as the easiest way for local businesses to create content that attracts local customers.

## Goals

1. **Simplify User Experience**: Reduce the interface to a simple 2-step process (Generate → Save/Export) that requires no SEO knowledge
2. **Focus on Local Businesses**: Prioritize service businesses (plumbers, electricians, cleaners, contractors) with industry-specific templates
3. **Remove Complexity**: Eliminate competitor monitoring, performance tracking, and agency-focused features that add complexity without core value
4. **High-Impact Features**: Add industry templates and mobile-first content optimization using existing AI capabilities
5. **Update Branding**: Reposition the tool specifically for small business owners rather than agencies
6. **Maintain Technical Foundation**: Keep existing backend functionality while simplifying the frontend experience
