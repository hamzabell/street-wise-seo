# PRD: SEO Agency Client Management Extensions

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines four key feature extensions to transform the existing SEO topic generator MVP into a comprehensive agency client management platform. These extensions will enable agencies to deliver professional client reports, generate AI-powered content briefs, track performance impact, and monitor competitor activities across multiple locations.

The goal is to provide agencies with tangible deliverables they can immediately hand to clients while building on our existing crawling and topic generation infrastructure.

## Goals

1. **Professional Client Deliverables**: Enable agencies to generate branded PDF reports and content roadmaps from crawl analysis
2. **AI-Powered Content Strategy**: Automatically generate comprehensive content briefs using existing crawl insights
3. **Performance Measurement**: Track SEO recommendation effectiveness through Google Search Console integration
4. **Competitive Intelligence**: Support multi-location campaigns and competitor monitoring capabilities
